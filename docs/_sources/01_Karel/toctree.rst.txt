So, what is programming actually?


A **Program** is a set of instructions for a computer. Everything that computers do, however diverse and complex, ultimately comes down to following these instructions, that is, execution of a program. By writing programs, you actually tell the computer: do this, do that. If the program is correctly written, when it is executed, the computer will actually do what you told it to do. Writing a program for a computer is what we call **programming**.

To speak to a computer, we have to use special languages, which are called **programming languages​​**. One of these languages is Python. Here we will practice writing programs in Python.

Some programming skills do not depend on the programming language we use to write a computer program in. The aim of these lessons is to help you master those general skills, which some people call *computational thinking*. We will deal with Python's special features (that are not present in other programming languages) only occasionally, when those features are necessary for understanding parts of a program being discussed.
